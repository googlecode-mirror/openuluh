OpenUluh is a intranet streaming solution for people who use XBMC to stream their videos to Mobile Devices such as iPhones, iPods, iPads and Android devices using HTML5, JavaScript and PHP.

You can also stream to another PC with Fullscreen HTML5 video as well. I realize that the desktop version isn't all the polished and could use some work.

Installation/Configuration:
Read INSTALL-1STREAD.txt inside the archive.

This is not a Web Interface addon for XBMC, this is setup on a separate webserver installation on the same PC.

### Current Stable Version: Not available ###
All stable builds have been deprecated after finding some broken SVN commits and subsequently broken files. Please use the Unstable package for now. Unstable is only untested if the library uses AVI files.

## Downloading Source ##
Please use the source code from [Github](http://github.com/ShadowEO/OpenUluh). Feel free to Watch the source, fork it or whatever you will. I simply wish to use GitHub so that I can manage merges and forks easier than Google Code would allow, and others can come and collaborate.

### Current Unstable Version: 0.1.7.3 Proposed Stable (Ready.) ###
Features:
  * All of the previous version's features.
  * New UI
  * Pagination
  * Preliminary support for multiple synchronized XBMC instances (Still needs installs on master)
  * Mobile Interface fixed, no longer too wide for the mobile screen.
  * Fixed downloading files to Mobile Device.

Sorry about 0.1.7.3's description version number, I typed it wrong when labeling it, I'll fix it soon

Want to help test out the latest experimental? Download it and open task manager or the equivalent for your OS and look for FFmpeg after pointing Chrome (or your browser of choice) to http://localhost:port/openuluh-root-here/stream.php?e=1 and see if you get either an error message or a bunch of garbage (raw data) then post the error or experience on the discussion group in the links section to your left please.

Want to help work on the project? feel free to create an issue and upload a patch with your contribution, If it's starred enough I will probably apply the patch the the unstable version.

**_SVN is fixed, go ahead and checkout experimental and for the love of god, please, please give feedback!._**
